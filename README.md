# How Best to Relax

For most of us it's a 9-12 h per day schedule. Life is hectic and fast-paced. Balance is a luxury and rather unheard of. Yet, more than ever it is of paramount importance to take breaks, put life into perspective, reevaluate decisions and plan for the future. In this post I am discussing a few stressbusters to take a time-out and at the same time perform with zest, purpose and zeal.

## 1) Short breaks

Work will always be around and bound to keep you busy. Momentum is important. Your time is valuable. When you feel like you can't work anymore it's time to invest into recovery. Taking short breaks helps to recharge, but similar to muscle training where your body doesn't completely disconnect from a small pause after each set of repetitions, you get ready and excited for the next round. Eat little meals in between to avoid starving.

## 2) Long breaks

You don't have to work constantly to achieve your dreams. Even though your intentions are good this bad habit can leave you so exhausted that your work begins to suffer. To unwind close your laptop after work. Take weekends off and enjoy them to the fullest! Use your breaks to explore a new hobby, spend time with family and reconnect with old friends.

## 3) Power Yoga

Power Yoga is more intense than regular yoga and a great complimentary exercise to running, weight training or team sports. Also, it involves many variations of stretching and toning to keep your body in shape and healthy. Additionally, mindful silence helps to relax and recollect your thoughts. You learn how to keep your mind focussed and lengthen your attention span so you can focus longer and harder than ever before.

## 4) Saying No

People prefer to spend their time with friends who are calm, relaxed and stress-free. Thus, don't overcommit and underdeliver! Don't let (unrealistic) deadlines stress you out or make your nervous! Stress breeds anxiety, self-doubt and low self-esteem. Just say no and move on.

## 5) Don't overplan

Too much planning will lead to disappointments and wear you out. It may also lead to outdated goals. Further, too much stability will suck the excitement right out of your life. And you are never going to start in the first place! That's why you need spontaneity to get inspired and try new things. A single spontaneous adventure can nurture the more creative and passionate sides of your personality. Sometimes, a new opportunity might present itself. As you grow towards your goals they will get more concrete. You will get an understanding of what you like and what you don't.

## 6) Nourish your brain

A single glass of water can boost your brain power. It helps you digest information, store new memories and solve more complicated problems by keeping your brain functioning. Moreover, a cup of tea quickens your short-term memory, strengthens your long-term memory and leaves you feeling enthusiastic about learning something new.
