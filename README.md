# How Best to Relax

For most of us it's a 9-12h per day schedule. Life is hectic and fast-paced. Balance is a luxury and rather unheard of. Yet, more than ever it is of paramount importance to take breaks, put life into perspective, reevaluate decisions and plan for the future. In this post I am discussing a few stressbusters to take a time-out and at the same time perform with zest and zeal.

## 1) Short breaks

Taking short breaks helps to recharge, but similar to muscle training where your body doesn't completely disconnect from a small pause after each set of repetitions, you get ready for the next round. Eat little meals in between to avoid starving.

## 2) Long breaks

Work will always be around and bound to keep you busy. Thus, close your laptop after work. Take weekends off and enjoy them to the fullest!

## 3) Power Yoga

Power Yoga is more intense than regular yoga and a great complimentary exercise to running, weight training or team sports. Also, it involves many variations of stretching and toning to keep your body in shape and healthy. Silence also helps to relax and recollect your thoughts.

## 4) Saying No

Don't overcommit and underdeliver! Don't let (unrealistic) deadlines stress you out! Just say no and move on.

## 5) Don't overplan

Too much planning will lead to disappointments and wear you out. Go with the flow and use the rule of thumb to estimate and set goals daily. Further, too much stability will suck the excitement right out of your life. That's why you need spontaneity to get inspired and try new things. A single spontaneous adventure can nurture the more creative and passionate sides of your personality.

## 6) Nourish your brain

A single glass of water can boost your brain power. It helps you digest information, store new memories and solve more complicated problems by keeping your brain functioning. Moreover, a cup of team quickens your short-term memory, strengthens your long-term memory and leaves you feeling enthusiastic about learning something new.
